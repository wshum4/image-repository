    <p>Least to say, 2020 was a big year. For many, the pandemic
    have put us in difficult situations. For others, this has been an
    opportunity for self reflection and appreciation of what is around us.
    As we hope that our lives will return back to normal soon, this site is
    dedicated to reflect what you appreciated during the lockdown and inspire
    those to look for a positive way to continue on until all is normal again.</p>

    <p>Read me: Feel free to scroll and see what other users have posted. If you
    would like to see more photos uploaded by them or read their descriptions, you
